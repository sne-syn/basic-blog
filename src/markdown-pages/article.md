Computers can communicate with each other as humans do. They can talk and listen, participate in a dialog or a polylog, and broadcast the information. The computers can send the data carefully, making sure that at the other end, the message was fully received. Or they can be in a rush, trying to send as much data as possible and give an overview of it to the receiver without delay.

To understand networking, we have to know the components involved in the communication process. 

Cables
Lots of different cables can be used to allow computers to communicate with each other. Cables connect different devices allowing data to be transmitted over them.

In the '60s, commercial computers were widely used in research labs and big companies. However, the data exchange between machines and their users was quite old-fashioned: with punched cards, representing the data by absence or presence of holes in predefined positions, or with magnetic tapes, usually located in the vault. Also, there was no way to share external devices like printers or storage drives. 

With cables, people were able to connect different devices and send the data through them. Cables are still widely used today. The most popular types of wires to create computer networks nowadays are copper and fiber cables.Computers can communicate with each other as humans do.
