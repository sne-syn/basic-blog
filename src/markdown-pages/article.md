Computers can communicate with each other as humans do. They can talk and listen, participate in a dialog or a polylog, and broadcast the information. The computers can send the data carefully, making sure that at the other end, the message was fully received. Or they can be in a rush, trying to send as much data as possible and give an overview of it to the receiver without delay.

To understand networking, we have to know the components involved in the communication process. 

## Cables
Lots of different cables can be used to allow computers to communicate with each other. Cables connect different devices allowing data to be transmitted over them.

In the '60s, commercial computers were widely used in research labs and big companies. However, the data exchange between machines and their users was quite old-fashioned: with punched cards, representing the data by absence or presence of holes in predefined positions, or with magnetic tapes, usually located in the vault. Also, there was no way to share external devices like printers or storage drives. 

With cables, people were able to connect different devices and send the data through them. Cables are still widely used today. The most popular types of wires to create computer networks nowadays are copper and fiber cables.

Copper cables are the most common form of networking cables. They are made of pairs of copper wires covered with rubber or plastic. They are cheaper than fiber cables. They send binary data (1s and 0s) by changing the voltage between two ranges: 2 volts and above = 1, 0.8 volts or less = 0. Voltages between 0.8 volts and 2.0 volts are considered illegal - noise.
 
Fiber optical cables contain optical fibers made of glass and present binary data by pulses of light (light on = 1, light off = 0). They are also favored in environments with lots of electrical interference because they can impact data sent through copper wires.  Fiber cables have lower latency than copper cables and can send data in a long distance but are much more expensive and fragile.
 
**Latency** - the time it takes for a message to be transferred.
 
## Devices
Using cable, we can connect one computer with another - point-to-point connection. But how to connect several devices in one network and share data among them? At this point, we will need Network Devices. One of the most basic and straightforward devices is a Hub.
### Hub 
allows connecting lots of computers and transmits data through their cables.
