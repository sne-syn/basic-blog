# Computer Networks

The Internet is one of the most important inventions of the XX century! It allows us to chat with friends, visit art galleries from home, receive online education, and vote. The ability to exchange information around the Globe forever changed the world.

Latency - The time it takes for a message to transfer.

In the '60s scientific commercials computers were already widely used in research labs and big companies. However, the data exchange between machines and their users was quite old-fashioned:  with punched cards, representing the data by absence or presence of holes in predefined positions, or with magnetic tapes, usually located in the vault. To be more productive and economically sustainable big companies had to find a way to share access to the expensive physical resources like printers or storage drives. It was impractical not to share them among several computers. From this practical needs was born an idea of LAN (Local Area Networks) - a relatively small network of close-by computers (2 machines or university campus with thousands of computers). One of the most famous and widely used until today was the Ethernet (earliest '70s), created by Xerox PARC. Series of computers connected to a single, common ethernet cable. Whan a computer 'A' wants to share data with another computer, it writes data as an electrical signal and sends it through the cable, pointing MAC address of its communicator. All the computers will see the signal but may ignore it if they are not the recipient.
